# .Net Version Checker
.Net Version Checker simple tool to check installed .Net Framework version 1.0 to 4.8.1

# Why
Originally it checked if .Net 1.0 and 1. was intalled.

However, it still is mainained as of following points:
Most moden checker are in .NET or Powershell, makes abolute no sense at all for me, except for windows 10 onwards.
Allot of checkers I found ared in C++ and also needed a Runtime (VC Runtime)
So lets try FreePascal, ASM would be best, but thats to complicated for me

Update 2026:
Found ASoft .Net Version Detector, seems quite good and more advanced
